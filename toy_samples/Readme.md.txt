### Data for Inpainting and Outpainting

- **images**: These are clean images. Apply the masks below to generate the corrupted measurements.
- **inp_masks**: Masks to be used to generate corrupted images for inpainting.
- **outp_masks**: Same as inp_masks but for outpainting.
- **real_data**: Contains real data for which clean images are not available.

Different masks can be applied to a single clean image to generate multiple corrupted images.
